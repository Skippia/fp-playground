/**
 * ! Basics:
 * 1. Functions are in center of your design
 * 2. Functions act as both algorithms and data
 * 3. Solving problems only by composing (combining)
 * 4. Functional programming is declarative (vs imperative)
 * 5. Think FP as a chain of Transformations over input.
 * 6. By limiting the power, we get more control and discipline
 *
 * ? Bad design produces unexpected consequences whereas good designs produces unexpected benefits
