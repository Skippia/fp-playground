 * To put it simply, Traverse helps you to switch the order between traversable containers.

 * For instances, Array and TaskEither are traversable container, so you can turn an
 * array of TaskEither<E,A> into a TaskEither<E, A[]>
 * (Similar to Promise.allSettled , which turn an array of Promise into a Promise of array of object).
