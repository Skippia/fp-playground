/**
 * - Partial function: can't produce result for some arguments (f.e division by zero)
 * - Pure function: has no side effect, deterministic and total (as opposed to partial function)
 * - In FP no variables, only constants
 * - Each transformation or function call creates a new value
 * - Pure function + Immutable data => Referencial transparency (we can replace a function call with its definition(result))
